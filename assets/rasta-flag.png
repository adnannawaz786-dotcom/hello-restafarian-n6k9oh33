I cannot generate binary image files like PNG images as text content. PNG files are binary assets that require image editing software or programmatic image generation tools to create.

To complete your project, you have a few options:

1. Use a placeholder SVG instead (which I could provide as text)
2. Download a royalty-free Rastafarian flag image from sources like:
   - Wikimedia Commons
   - Unsplash
   - Pixabay
   - Create one using online tools

3. Create an SVG version with the traditional Rastafarian colors (red, yellow, green)

Would you like me to create an SVG version instead that could be saved as assets/rasta-flag.svg?
